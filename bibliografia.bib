    abstract = {This paper proposes a new algorithm for training support vector machines: Sequential Minimal Optimization, or SMO. Training a support vector machine requires the solution of a very large quadratic programming (QP) optimization problem. SMO breaks this large QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems. These small QP problems are solved analytically, which avoids using a time-consuming numerical QP optimization as an inner loop. The amount of memory required for SMO is linear in the training set size, which allows SMO to handle very large training sets. Because matrix computation is avoided, SMO scales somewhere between linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test problems, while the standard chunking SVM algorithm scales somewhere between linear and cubic in the training set size. SMO's computation time is dominated by SVM evaluation, hence SMO is fastest for linear SVMs and sparse data sets. On real-world sparse data sets, SMO can be more than 1000 times faster than the chunking algorithm.},

First, a SVM is initially trained by all the training samples, thereby producing a number of support vectors. Second, the support vectors, which make the hypersurface highly convoluted, are excluded from the training set. Third, the SVM is re-trained only by the remaining samples in the training set. Finally, the complexity of the trained SVM is further reduced by approximating the separation hypersurface with a subset of the support vectors. Compared to the initially trained SVM by all samples, the efficiency of the finally-trained SVM is highly improved, without system degradation.}

The reduction process iteratively selects two nearest support vectors belonging to the same class and replaces them by a newly constructed vector. Through the analysis of relation between vectors in the input and feature spaces, we present the construction of new vectors that requires to find the unique maximum point of a one-variable function on the interval (0, 1), not to minimize a function of many variables with local minimums in former reduced set methods. Experimental results on real life datasets show that the proposed method is effective in reducing number of support vectors and preserving machine's generalization performance.},

In contrast, previous analyses of stochastic gradient descent methods for SVMs require {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}Omega(1 / {\backslash}epsilon^2){\}}{\$}{\$}iterations. As in previously devised SVM solvers, the number of iterations also scales linearly with 1/$\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter of SVM. For a linear kernel, the total run-time of our method is {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}tilde{\{}O{\}}(d/({\backslash}lambda {\backslash}epsilon)){\}}{\$}{\$}, where d is a bound on the number of non-zero features in each example. Since the run-time does not depend directly on the size of the training set, the resulting algorithm is especially suited for learning from large datasets. Our approach also extends to non-linear kernels while working solely on the primal objective function, though in this case the runtime does depend linearly on the training set size. Our algorithm is particularly well suited for large text classification problems, where we demonstrate an order-of-magnitude speedup over previous SVM learning methods.},

We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will find that even old material is cast in a fresh light.},
